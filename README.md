# using-watson-stt

The python script uses the Watson STT websocket to transcribe audio files that are stored on S3, and store the transcriptions on S3. This script makes use of the `sttClient.py` from the github repository linked to above. It uses the threading capability to establish multiple connection with Watson at once and transcribe a batch of audio files simultaneously. It also assumes that the audio files are `.wav` files, stored in a sub-bucket named `AUDIO_FILES`, which is a sub-bucket of the bucket `bucket_name`. It further assumes that the audio files are 8khz single channel wave files (e.g. recorded phone calls); this is important because you need to tell Watson to use the correct acoustic model to transcribe the audio files. The output is then stored on S3 with appropriate filenames.
